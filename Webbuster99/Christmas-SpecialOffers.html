                <strong>Christmas</strong> is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed
                primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the
                world.A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the
                Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve
                days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries is celebrated
                religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians and forms an
                integral part of the holiday season organized around it.

                The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that
                Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies.When Joseph and Mary arrived in the
                city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with
                angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then spread the word. For two millennia, people around the
                world have been observing it with traditions and practices that are both religious and secular in
                nature. Christians celebrate Christmas Day as the anniversary of the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, a
                spiritual leader whose teachings form the basis of their religion. Popular customs include exchanging
                gifts, decorating Christmas trees, attending church, sharing meals with family and friends and, of
                course, waiting for Santa Claus to arrive. December 25—Christmas Day—has been a federal holiday in the
                United States since 1870.
